# MicrocontrollerSudokuGame

Specifically, this game will be designed as a cooperative system implemented in the 
PIC18F4321 microcontroller. The logic of the game (the numbers that appear and their 
verification) will be implemented with a program written in Java. The microcontroller will 
be the responsible for interacting with the user, and therefore, must communicate with 
the computer in order to control the movement of the player and the numbers entered, 
along with the evolution of the game
